Capstone 1: 

Assume that you have been approached by a small financial company and asked to create a program that allows the user to access two different financial calculators: an investment calculator and a home loan repayment calculator.

Write the code that will do the following:

1. The user should be allowed to choose which calculation they want to do. The first output that the user sees when the program runs should look like this :

2. How the user capitalises their selection should not affect how the program proceeds. i.e. ‘Bond’, ‘bond’, ‘BOND’ or ‘investment’, ‘Investment’, ‘INVESTMENT’, etc., should all be recognised as valid entries. If the user doesn’t type in a valid input, show an appropriate error message.

3. If the user selects ‘investment’, do the following:   
- Ask the user to input:
- The amount of money that they are depositing.
- The interest rate (as a percentage). Only the number of the interest
rate should be entered.
- The number of years they plan on investing.
- Then ask the user to input if they want “simple” or “compound”
interest, and store this in a variable called interest. 

Depending on whether or not they typed “simple” or “compound”, output the appropriate amount that they will get back after the given period, at the specified interest rate. 

4. If the user selects ‘bond’, do the following: 
- Ask the user to input:
- The present value of the house. e.g. 100000
- The interest rate. e.g. 7
- The number of months they plan to take to repay the bond.
- Calculate how much money the user will have to repay each month and output the answer.
